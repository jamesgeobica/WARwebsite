   <img src="https://teamimage6.jpg" style="float:left width=225>
The scouting subteam is active during the competitions Team 4533 partakes in. Their data-collecting is essential for the longterm success 
of the team during competitions. The scouting subteam is responsible for analyzing the performance of other bots during competitions, 
which helps the team to decide which bots at the competitions are the best match for our team's robot to ensure maximum success 
during alliance selections with other teams. Without the scout team, strong alliances with other teams cannot be created, lowering the
team's chances of reaching far in the FIRST competitions.
